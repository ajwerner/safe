\begin{abstract}
The recent revelations of the NSA's large scale surveillance programs have spurred interest in the general public and the research community around issues related to privacy. Although there have been effective tools for end-to-end encryption for a quite some time, adoption remains shockingly low, due to inconvenience,  difficulty of use, poor user interface design, or overly complicated models of trust. In this paper we present Safe, an easy to use, easy to comprehend interface for users to share their secure identities across multiple devices and other users based on simple metaphors such as owns a device and knows a person. Safe is a scalable, secure trust-management system built on top of untrusted Amazon Web Services.

Safe offers many of the same usability primitives as UIA \cite{uia} but is also in some ways antithetical to UIA because it operates completely on Amazon managed infrastructure. That being said Safe actually implements a much more useful naming system in that it also provides security credentials and identity guarantees on all users available to it.

The data security and fork consistency draws heavily on the work in SUNDR \cite{sundr}. We implement a similar encryption and modification signature-logging scheme to provide the security guarantees in the face of privacy, forgery, or rollback attacks and detection of forking.

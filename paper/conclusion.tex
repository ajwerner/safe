\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Safe achieves what we have envisioned; an easy to use, easy to program library to perform end - to - end cryptography while hiding all the intricacies of public key cryptography from the end user. Underneath the simple easy to comprehend relationship model presented by Safe, there exists powerful cryptography that makes every user a Certificate Authority to his own devices and provides authenticity to devices he owns when communicating with devices of other trusted users in the system. 

Although PGP and GPG have been around to for sometime, their adoption has been hindered by difficult to use interfaces and key servers limitations. Safe's usefulness comes not only from it's relationship model but also advances in cloud computing that offers infrastructure/platform as a scalable service (such as Amazon AWS in Safe's case) and the ability to build trusted services on top of them. In the future the ideas in Safe could be ported to different platforms to make it even more useful and user friendly than it already is.
